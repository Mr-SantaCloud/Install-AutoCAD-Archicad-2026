# PSADT script to install AutoCAD Archicad 2026
This script is tested and working to install and uninstall AutoCAD Archicad 2026 with Microsoft Intune

1. Log into your Autodesk account and create a deployment package first

2. Here is how you do it:

3. Run your created deployment package to get the same extracted folder structure as the script

4. Create your Win32 app in Intune and deploy

   
OBS! the files in the folders are dummy files and folders to demonstrate the folder structure for installation

I have created a .txt file and renamed it to .exe for demonstration purposes
